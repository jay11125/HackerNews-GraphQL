## How to use

### 1. Clone repository

```sh
git clone https://github.com/jay11125/HackerNews-GraphQL.git
```

### 2. Start the backend server

Go to the `backend` folder, install dependencies and start the server.

```sh
cd backend
npm install
npm start
```

> **Note**: If you want to interact with the GraphQL API of the server inside a [GraphQL Playground](https://github.com/prisma/graphql-playground), you can navigate to [http://localhost:4000](http://localhost:4000).

### 3. Run the app

Now that the server is running, you can start the React app as well. The commands need to be run in a new terminal tab/window inside the `frontend` directory (because the current tab is blocked by the process running the server):

```sh
npm install
npm start
```

You can now open your browser and use the app on [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000).
